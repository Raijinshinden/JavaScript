//Variables = A container that stores a value.
//Behaves as if it were the value it contains.

//There are two steps to creating a variable.
//1. declaration     let x;
//2. assignment      x = 100;

//let age = 25;
//let price = 10.99;
//let gpa = 2.1;


//let firstname = "Ryan";
//let lastName = "Dempsey";
//let favoriteFood = "pizza";
//let email = "ryan911@googleplex.com";

//Using a template literal, we can insert a variable using a placeholder.
//console.log(`You are ${age} years old.`);
//console.log(`The price is $${price}.`);
//console.log(`Your gpa is: ${gpa}`);

//If we need to display the datatype of a variable, we can use console.log(), and precede the variable with the type of keyword.
//console.log(typeof price);
//console.log(typeof age);
//console.log(typeof gpa);

//console.log(typeof firstname);
//console.log(`Your name is ${firstname}.`);
//console.log(`You like ${favoriteFood}.`);
//console.log(`Your email is ${email}`);

//let online = true;
//let forSale = false;

//console.log(`Bro is online: ${online}`);
//console.log(`Is this car for sale: ${forSale}`);


//let fullName = "Ryan Dempsey";
//let age = 27;
//let isStudent = false;

//To change the text content of an html element.

//document.getElementById("p1").textContent = `Your name is ${fullName}`;
//document.getElementById("p2").textContent = `You are ${age} years old`;
//document.getElementById("p3").textContent = `Enrolled in school: ${isStudent}`;

//Arithmetic Operators

let students = 30;

//students = students + 1;
//students = students - 1;
//students = students * 1;
//students = students / 1;
//students = students ** 2; This is an exponent (to the power of 2).
// students = students % 2; This is the modulus operator (returns the remainder of a division).


console.log(students)
